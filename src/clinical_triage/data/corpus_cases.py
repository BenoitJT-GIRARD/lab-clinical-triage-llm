"""Extracting the triage cases that the public corpora can actually supply.

Public medical corpora are not triage sets. Taking them as they are — wrapping "Levamisole is
used as all except -" inside "A patient presents with:" then labelling it because the word
"infection" appears — produces absurd training targets. This module does the sorting.

Two transformations only, both verifiable by reading:

1. **exam clinical vignettes** (MedMCQA, FrenchMedMCQA). Some questions open on a genuine
   patient presentation: "A 60-year-old chronic smoker presents with painless gross hematuria of
   1 day duration." That presentation is kept and the exam question that follows it is removed.
2. **symptom descriptions** (MedQuAD). Entries of type ``symptoms`` describe the signs of a
   condition; they become a patient's complaint.

The label then comes from the triage rule, with a **``medium`` confidence level** that
distinguishes it from the catalogue vignettes. One safety rule frames that label: **a case is
kept only when the rule explicitly identifies a sign**. The absence of a detected sign does not
prove the absence of severity — "suspected pneumoperitoneum" contains no alert keyword and
remains a surgical emergency. Manufacturing a "deferred consultation" label out of the rule's
silence would be dangerous; the non-urgent cases therefore come from the catalogue, where they
are described and validated one by one.

The patterns are French and English clinical vocabulary: they are the data being matched.
