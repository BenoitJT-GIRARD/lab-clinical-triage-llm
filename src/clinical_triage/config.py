"""Central configuration of the triage project.

Every path, seed and hyper-parameter lives here, in frozen dataclasses. One place is
authoritative: notebooks, scripts and tests import these constants instead of redefining them,
which is what makes a training run relaunched six months later start from the same values.

Hugging Face repository ids can be overridden by environment variable (``HF_NAMESPACE``), so
that another account can republish the dataset and the weights without touching the code.

This module is imported by everything else, so this is where the ``.env`` file is loaded,
once, and scripts, tests and the service all see the same settings without each having to care.
