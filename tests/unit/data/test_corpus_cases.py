"""Tests of the extraction filters applied to the public corpora.

They lock down defects that really did truncate the delivered dataset: a marker blind to
MediQAl's syntax, a truncation mid-word, and a length bound set by eye rather than on the
service's budget. The last ones verify that the funnel published in the dataset card really
describes what the extraction does, and not what one believes it does.
