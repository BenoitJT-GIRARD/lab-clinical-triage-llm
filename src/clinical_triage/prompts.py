"""The agent's dialogue format — single source of truth.

The same template serves supervised fine-tuning, preference alignment, evaluation and the
service. That is deliberate: the slightest divergence between the format learnt and the format
served degrades the answers without any training metric reporting it.

Two precautions matter:

- our own ChatML template is installed on the tokenizer (:func:`install_chat_template`) and
  saved with the model. Qwen3's native template inserts a ``<think></think>`` block before the
  assistant's answer; the training libraries apply that template as soon as a dataset exposes a
  ``messages`` column, which would teach the model a format inference never reproduces;
- ``<|im_end|>`` is declared as the end-of-sequence token
  (:func:`install_end_of_turn_token`). The Qwen3-1.7B-Base tokenizer ships with
  ``<|endoftext|>`` as end of sequence: without this correction, generation never stops at the
  end of the triage answer.

The prompt and the answer format are French because the model answers in French: they are the
data the model was trained on, not prose about the project.
