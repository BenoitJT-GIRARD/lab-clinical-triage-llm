"""Serialisation, splitting and documentation of the dataset.

The format is the one the training libraries expect, and it is the same from SFT to serving:

- supervised set: ``prompt`` (the ChatML exchange up to the opening of the assistant turn) and
  ``completion`` (the expected answer). That pair lets training compute the loss on the answer
  only, with no special collator;
- preference set: ``prompt``, ``chosen``, ``rejected``, with exactly the same prompt as above.

Both sets therefore share, word for word, the format used at inference. The clinical metadata
travels in extra columns, which training ignores but which make the dataset auditable.
