"""Preference alignment (DPO) above the fine-tuned model, with Unsloth.

SFT teaches the model to answer; DPO teaches it to prefer. Here the preference is about clinical
safety: between two answers to the same case, the wanted one does not underestimate the urgency,
does not delay care, does not assert a diagnosis and respects the imposed language.

Four method choices, all meant to stop the alignment from undoing the work of the SFT:

1. **the reference is the SFT model, not the base model.** The merged SFT model is loaded and a
   *new* LoRA adapter is attached to it. The library then uses the model with its adapter
   disabled as the reference: that is exactly the SFT model. Taking the base model as reference
   would allow DPO to drift away from the format just learnt.
2. **``rpo_alpha`` adds the supervised loss on the preferred answer.** DPO alone optimises a
   likelihood ratio: it can lower the probability of both answers as long as the gap widens.
   This second term keeps the preferred answer at a high likelihood.
3. **the adapter does not touch the output head.** SFT already did, and the merged model that
   serves as the base therefore knows how to stop. Leaving the head out of the adapter keeps it
   small — and above all servable hot by vLLM, which refuses adapters carrying a
   ``modules_to_save``.
4. **a validation split is held out.** Without it the only curves available are the training
   ones, and nothing distinguishes an alignment that generalises from one that memorises.
