"""Loading the public medical corpora.

Four corpora are required: MediQAl, FrenchMedMCQA, MedQuAD and UltraMedical-Preference. This
module only downloads them and brings them to a common shape; sorting what is genuinely usable
for triage happens in ``corpus_cases``.

Three findings, checked on the corpora themselves, explain what follows:

- **MediQAl is the only one containing real clinical vignettes.** Its ``clinical_case`` column
  describes a patient, their complaint, their history and often their vital signs on arrival.
  3,075 distinct vignettes, in French, 569 of which carry at least one readable vital sign. It
  is the only authentic French-language source.
- **FrenchMedMCQA holds 1,080 questions** across its three splits, and only six of them describe
  a patient: it is a set of pharmacy exam questions.
- **MedQuAD asks general questions about conditions**, not about patients. It serves to vary the
  English clinical vocabulary, not to supply cases.

MedMCQA completes the English vignette volume, since the three usable required corpora are
either French-language or patient-free.

**The corpora are read in full.** A partial read would give a yield that describes not the
source but the ceiling we set ourselves, and the published protocol would draw false conclusions
about what the corpora allow. The ``limit`` parameter exists for quick trials; at zero it bounds
nothing.

Two failures, two behaviours. **A source unreachable at opening** is reported and skipped; the
preparation script then checks that each expected corpus did supply entries, and refuses to
build a truncated dataset silently. **A read interrupted mid-way** stops everything: the
published yield is computed on the number of entries read, and a partial read absorbed in
silence would produce a table describing half a corpus while presenting it as the whole.
